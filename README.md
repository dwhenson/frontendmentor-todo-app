# Frontend Mentor - Todo app

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

Notes:

- Don't confuse DOM elements with data object
- Using insertAdjacentHTML means can either not add to top or not add to bottom - to fix would need to use index of drop element or something?
- No ticks on chrome
- DD not working on FF
- iOS nightmare
